# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mikheil Kharazishvili
ðŸ’» .NET Backend Developer | Focused on Scalable Business Solutions

## Profile

After 12 years in business management and earning an MBA, I made a purposeful transition into software development â€” driven by a passion for solving business-critical challenges through clean code and scalable systems.
As a .NET Backend Developer, I specialize in C#, ASP.NET Core, and SQL, focusing on building maintainable backend solutions using clean architecture and domain-driven design.
With a blend of technical execution and business insight, I design systems that are efficient, scalable, and aligned with long-term goals. Known for fast learning, adaptability, and a strong sense of ownership, I thrive in collaborative, high-paced environments where technical excellence, impact, and continuous improvement matter most.
