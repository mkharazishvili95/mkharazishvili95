# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate .NET developer, with a strong foundation in C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, and other key technologies. Over the past few years, I've dedicated myself to continuous learning and hands-on projects, crafting innovative solutions to complex challenges.

## Profile

I am a motivated and detail-oriented .NET developer with experience in backend development and microservices architecture. My journey into programming began after a successful career in business management, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Driven by a passion for technology, I dedicated two years to intensive learning, completing rigorous courses and building personal projects to gain hands-on experience.
As a .NET Developer at Lemondo, I work extensively with C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, and microservices, contributing to backend development, system integrations, and performance optimization. I am committed to continuous learning, and solving complex challenges. I thrive in dynamic environments and am eager to apply my expertise to build impactful software solutions.
