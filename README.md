# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate .NET developer, with a strong foundation in C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, and other key technologies. Over the past few years, I've dedicated myself to continuous learning and hands-on projects, crafting innovative solutions to complex challenges.

## Profile

As a passionate and detail-oriented .NET developer, I have dedicated the last two years to honing my skills through intensive learning and hands-on projects. My journey into programming is driven by my love of continuous development and problem-solving. I have successfully completed challenging courses and created several comprehensive projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex challenges and come up with innovative solutions.

With a solid foundation in C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, and other key technologies, I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My experience in business management, gained from working in my family's company for more than a decade, has equipped me with strong analytical and organizational skills that further enhance my approach to software development.

I am eager to leverage my technical experience, hard work, and passion for programming to make an effective contribution as a junior .NET developer. I am detail-oriented, thrive in dynamic environments, and am enthusiastic about taking on new challenges in software development.
